                        <p>O.D. Vazquez is a composer and musician currently studying at Duquesne University. He has performed both classical and original works throughout the US. Most notably, he has performed in the Cherry Blossom Parade in D.C. and as a chorus member on stage with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra at Heinz Hall.</p>
                        
                        <p>Described as an "operatic innovator", Mr. Vazquez hopes to earn that title through his current project, Broke Man's Opera. A spin on classical opera, this project seeks to take the opera repertoire and arrange it into modern genres. His starting works will focus on bluegrass and American folk genres, but he hopes to work with other genres in the future. In addition to new music, he wants to bring staging to the new age using the latest technology to bring the sets to life as well as make performing accessible to those who may not have been able to in the past.</p>
                        
                        <p>This season, performance highlights include scenes from Britten's operas A Midsummer Nights Dream and The Turn of the Screw as well as playing Leporello in the final scene of Mozart's Don Giovanni. He will also be a featured soloist for The Duke's Music ensemble at Duquesne University.</p>
                        
                        <p>In 2024, he played the roles of Maestro Spinelloccio and Ser Amantio di Nicolao in Puccini's Gianni Schicchi. This also marked his start in the Hamlisch-Page Student Choir where he sang with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra as a part of the chorus for their concert production of Fiddler on the Roof. In 2023, he won the Marguerite DePhillips Dougherty Voice Competition Undergraduate Award.</p>

                        <p>From a young age, Mr. Vazquez has worked with music. He took dance lessons as a toddler until the age of four when he found more of a passion for music itself. Since then, he has written music and performed whenever and wherever he has had the chance.</p>

                        <p>A lover of all instruments, Mr. Vazquez has professionally studied voice, piano, organ, bassoon, and percussion. Favoring the Baroque era, his musical repertoire consists heavily of pieces and roles from George Frideric Handel and Henry Purcell. However, he also performs musical theater pieces as well as other genres of contemporary commercial music (CCM). Though he performs primarily in the classical style, he composes a large array of music in various genres, especially minimalism and bluegrass. His compositional style can be described as an eclectic mix of classical, folk, and electronic music.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Vazquez received his BS in Psychology from the College of Coastal Georgia in 2017. He is currently pursuing his BA in Music from Duquesne University and is set to graduate in May, 2025.</p>
